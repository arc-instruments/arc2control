`0.1.0`_ â€” 2022-08-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This is the latest release

This is the initial somewhat functional release of ArC2Control. Bugs are still
to be expected. Aim is to present a stable API for further module development
and expose some of the functionality of ArC TWO. Highlights of this initial
release are

* Initial version of the HDF5-based format for data storage and retrieval
* Firmware management tool
* First version of the public module API - built-in modules use the same public
  API
* Two built-in modules: CurveTracer and Retention
* Manual pulse and read operations
* Full or reduced (masked) crossbar support
* Flexible channel mappers
* Adjustable plot displays for Current, Resistance or Conductance
