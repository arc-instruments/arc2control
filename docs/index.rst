ArC TWO Control Panel
=====================

.. important::
   If you recently acquired an ArC TWO it is recommended that you go through
   board's `ðŸ“– general documentation`_ first as it provides useful introductory
   information to get started with your instrument.

This is the reference application to interact with your ArC TWO multi-channel
characterisation platform. It is based on the pyarc2_ library which exposes a
Python interface to all the underlying functionality of ArC TWO. It is an
accessible way to familiarise yourself with ArC TWO and can serve as a platform
to further develop your own routines.

Installation
------------

ArC TWO Control Panel is always available from git. On stable releases
Windows installers and Linux AppImages will be made available from the
`release page`_.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/arc-instruments/arc2control

You will additionally need the necessary libusb driver to
interact with ArC TWO. ``pyarc2`` wheels will typically include the library
that implements the FPGA API (see beastlink_) but the actual USB driver should
be installed separately for your operating system. This is typically included
with the CESYS distribution of beastlink. Check `CESYS download page`_ for more
details. For Windows run the installer provided by CESYS. For Linux scripts to
generate suitable packages for Archlinux, Debian-based and RedHat compatible
distributions are available from `our repository`_.

At this moment ArC TWO Control Panel is only available for Windows and glibc
Linux x86_64.  That's due to limitations of beastlink. Minimal functionality
for browsing and analysing results will be provided for macOS soonâ„¢.
