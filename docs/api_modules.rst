ArC2Control emodules
====================

Introduction - emodules
-----------------------

ArC TWO Control Panel provides a mechanism for users to create their own
experiments using ArC TWO. These are typically specialised control panels
that are registered during program startup and are available from the
main ArC TWO Control Panel Experiment dropdown menu. We call the control
panels *external modules* or *emodules*.

An emodule is essentially a standalone Python project that exposes a few
interfaces that are compatible with the ArC TWO Control Panel.
