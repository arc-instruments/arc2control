class ChannelMapper:
    """
    ChannelMapper deals with conversions between word/bitlines and ArC2 channel
    numbers. ArC2 channels are arbitrary and can be operated independently. In a
    typical crossbar scenario some of these channels will be allocated to high
    potential terminals (wordlines) and others to low potential terminals (bitlines).
    This class provides convenience functions to switch back and forth.

    The most typical way of loading a mapper would be through `ChannelMapper.from_toml`
    to read the values from the configuration file, rather than create the objects
    manually.
